# BladeRecon Troubleshooting

Start with:

```bash
bladerecon doctor
```

Doctor checks optional dependencies and write permissions.

## Chromium Missing

Symptoms:

```text
[SKIP] Screenshot module skipped
Reason: Chromium browser not installed
```

Fix:

```bash
python -m playwright install chromium
bladerecon doctor
```

Screenshots are optional. Full scans continue when Chromium is missing.

## Nuclei Missing

Symptoms:

```text
[SKIP] Nuclei module skipped
Reason: nuclei binary not found in PATH
```

Fix:

```bash
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest
nuclei -version
bladerecon doctor
```

Ensure Go bin is in PATH.

The first install may look slow because Go downloads and compiles many dependencies. `bladerecon install-deps` prints progress and heartbeat messages during this stage.

## Nuclei Templates Missing

Symptoms:

```text
Nuclei templates missing; updating templates and retrying once
nuclei failed: templates unavailable at <home>/nuclei-templates
```

Fix:

```bash
bladerecon repair
bladerecon nuclei example.com
```

Manual template refresh:

```bash
nuclei -update-templates -update-template-dir ~/nuclei-templates
bladerecon nuclei example.com
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
bladerecon repair
nuclei -update-templates -update-template-dir "$env:USERPROFILE\nuclei-templates"
bladerecon nuclei example.com
```

This means the Nuclei binary exists, but its template store is empty or could not be downloaded.

## Nuclei Timed Out

Symptoms:

```text
Nuclei Status: Timed Out
Reason: timeout after <seconds>s
```

By default BladeRecon does not force-kill Nuclei with a module wall-clock timeout. If you pass `--timeout`, or enable `nuclei.enforce_module_timeout` in `config.yaml`, timed-out scans are reported clearly in `metadata.json`, `scan_state.json`, and the report.

For large targets, prefer:

```bash
bladerecon nuclei example.com --profile safe --timeout 900
```

If you do not want a wall-clock limit, omit `--timeout`.

## Rate Limits Or WAF Noise

Use the safe profile when a target starts returning `429`, WAF challenges, or connection resets:

```bash
bladerecon full example.com --profile safe
bladerecon probe example.com --profile safe
bladerecon js example.com --profile safe
bladerecon screenshot example.com --profile safe
bladerecon nuclei example.com --profile safe
bladerecon advanced example.com --profile safe
```

The safe profile lowers concurrency, per-host concurrency, request ceilings, and requests per second. The active profile is shown in reports.

## Advanced Recon Has Few Results

Advanced recon is intentionally low-noise. It does not run a generic dirbuster.

Check:

```bash
bladerecon probe example.com --profile safe
bladerecon js example.com --profile safe
bladerecon endpoints example.com
bladerecon advanced example.com --profile safe
```

Possible causes:

- Historical sources had little data for the target.
- The safe profile request ceilings were reached.
- CSP/security headers did not reference additional assets.
- Content discovery filtered generic 404/soft-404 responses.
- Historical JS references were absent or unavailable.

## Go Missing

Symptoms:

```text
go | WARN | Go not found on PATH
```

Fix:

1. Install Go from https://go.dev/dl/
2. Restart the terminal.
3. Verify:

```bash
go version
```

## PATH Issues

If a tool is installed but doctor cannot find it:

Windows:

```powershell
$env:Path
```

Add the tool directory to your user PATH, then restart PowerShell.

Common Go bin path:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\go\bin
```

## Permission Issues

Symptoms:

```text
permissions | WARN
```

Fix:

- Run BladeRecon from a writable project directory.
- Avoid protected system folders.
- Check antivirus or endpoint protection if files are locked.
- Use a custom output directory:

```bash
bladerecon full example.com -o results
```

## Empty Results

Empty results can be normal for invalid or low-surface targets.

Check:

```bash
bladerecon subdomain example.com
bladerecon probe example.com
type results\example.com\subdomains\subdomains.txt
type results\example.com\probe\alive.txt
```

Possible causes:

- Passive sources returned no data.
- Target has no alive HTTP services.
- Network, DNS, or proxy problems.
- Source rate limits or outages.

## No Parameters

Parameter discovery uses historical sources first, then local outputs such as endpoints, JavaScript files, and alive URLs.

If no URL sources exist:

```text
Parameter discovery skipped
Reason: No URL sources available
```

Run:

```bash
bladerecon probe example.com
bladerecon js example.com
bladerecon endpoints example.com
bladerecon param example.com
```

## Skipped Modules

Skipped does not mean failed.

Common skip states:

| Module | Reason | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Screenshots | Chromium browser not installed | `python -m playwright install chromium` |
| Nuclei | Binary not installed | Install Go and Nuclei |
| Nuclei | Templates unavailable | Run `bladerecon repair` or `nuclei -update-templates` |
| Nuclei | Timed Out | Increase `--timeout`, use `--profile safe`, or omit `--timeout` |
| Parameters | No URL sources available | Run probe/js/endpoints first |
| Advanced | No valid scan found | Run probe/js/endpoints/intelligence first |
| Chaos | API key not configured | Add a Chaos API key in `config.yaml` |

## Cache Issues

Show cache:

```bash
bladerecon cache info
```

Clear cache:

```bash
bladerecon cache clear
```

If files are locked on Windows, BladeRecon warns and continues cleanup safely.

## Docker Issues

Build:

```bash
docker build -t bladerecon .
```

Run doctor:

```bash
docker run --rm bladerecon doctor
```

Persist results:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "%cd%\results:/app/results" bladerecon full example.com
```

If volume mounting fails on Windows, use PowerShell:

```powershell
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}\results:/app/results" bladerecon full example.com
```
