BladeRecon is a lightweight reconnaissance framework for bug bounty, web pentesting, and reporting-focused attack-surface discovery. It keeps the workflow terminal-native and modular while producing clean TXT, JSON, JSONL, Markdown, and HTML outputs.

Developer: [Mohamed Kotb](https://github.com/mohamedxk9tb)

## Project Overview

BladeRecon helps you move from a target domain to a readable reconnaissance report:

```text
subdomains -> probe -> js -> endpoints -> secrets -> parameters -> intelligence -> advanced -> screenshots -> nuclei -> report
```

It is designed to be:

- Lightweight and Windows-friendly
- Beginner friendly without hiding operational details
- Useful for bug bounty and small pentest workflows that need safe defaults
- Easy to inspect manually, automate from files, and hand over as reports

It is not intended to replace Amass, distributed recon stacks, or enterprise scanners.

Use BladeRecon only on assets you own or are authorized to test. Public issue
reports and shared artifacts should be sanitized before posting.


### CLI Preview

![BladeRecon CLI preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohamedxk9tb/BladeRecon/main/assets/cli-preview.png)

The CLI preview demonstrates the terminal-first workflow: branded startup,
module status output, dependency checks, and scan summaries. This matters
because BladeRecon is designed for researchers who need to understand what is
running, what was skipped, and where artifacts were written.

Data policy: sanitized `example.com` target, no fake findings, no sensitive data.

### Report Preview

![BladeRecon report preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohamedxk9tb/BladeRecon/main/assets/report-preview.png)

The report preview demonstrates the dark offline report, including a decision
dashboard, start-here investigation queue, campaign test plans, supporting
evidence, findings status, and performance analytics. This matters because
BladeRecon's output is meant to help researchers prioritize follow-up work, not
just count discovered artifacts.

Data policy: sanitized sample data with zero fake findings.

## Installation

See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) for complete Windows, Python, Go, Nuclei, Playwright, Docker, and verification instructions.

Recommended install:

```bash
pipx install bladerecon
bladerecon doctor
```

Alternative install:

```bash
python -m pip install bladerecon
bladerecon doctor
```

Development install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedxk9tb/BladeRecon.git
cd BladeRecon
python -m venv .venv

## Doctor Command

Run doctor before the first real scan:

```bash
bladerecon doctor
```

Doctor checks:

- Go availability
- Nuclei availability
- Playwright package
- Chromium browser availability
- Results directory write permission

Optional dependencies can be missing. BladeRecon will skip the related modules and continue the workflow.

## Scan Safety Profiles

BladeRecon defaults to `balanced`. Use `safe` for bug bounty programs or shared infrastructure, and `aggressive` only when you explicitly want higher active-request volume.

| Profile | Intended Use | Active Safeguards |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `safe` | Bug bounty and conservative validation | Low concurrency, low RPS, tighter request ceilings, one request per host for HTTP/browser modules |
| `balanced` | Default day-to-day recon | Moderate concurrency, capped JS/screenshots/Nuclei targets, per-host limits |
| `aggressive` | Explicit opt-in speed | Higher ceilings and concurrency while still retaining rate limits |

Profiles control request pressure and ceilings, not a guaranteed wall-clock
ordering. A `safe` scan can take longer than `aggressive` when lower
concurrency, one-request-per-host browser work, retries, or target-side delays
dominate runtime. Reports show full scan duration and per-module timings so the
slow path is visible.

Examples:

```bash
bladerecon probe hackerone.com --profile safe
bladerecon js hackerone.com --profile safe
bladerecon screenshot hackerone.com --profile safe
bladerecon nuclei hackerone.com --profile safe
bladerecon full hackerone.com --profile safe
```

The active profile is written to the run marker, `scan_state.json`, module metadata, and the HTML report. `bladerecon resume <target>` resumes the latest isolated run and preserves that run's stored profile.

Smart Nuclei keeps technology-guided tag selection, but it is no longer the
only coverage layer. When tags are selected automatically, BladeRecon may run
a lightweight tag-free baseline pass for `critical,high` severities, but only
for uncovered high-confidence or validated opportunity hosts. When no tags,
validated attack surface, or high-confidence opportunities exist, the ROI gate
skips baseline-only Nuclei instead of spending runtime on low-value templates.
If the ROI gate justifies a baseline-only run, BladeRecon scopes the target list
to the validated or high-confidence opportunity hosts first instead of scanning
every alive host. Reports and `nuclei/metadata.json` show
`coverage_strategy`, `roi_decision`, `target_scope`, `baseline_reason`,
`baseline_skip_reason`, `baseline_roi`, `baseline_targets`, and the
`baseline_scan` status.
Explicit `--templates` paths can point to a single Nuclei template file or a
directory of custom templates; they do not need the official template repository
layout.

## Output Structure

Full scans are isolated by run. Each `bladerecon full <target>` creates a new
folder under `results/<target>/runs/`, and `results/<target>/latest_run.json`
points to the most recent valid run. `bladerecon report <target>` reads that
latest valid run; if no isolated run exists, it falls back to the legacy flat
`results/<target>/` layout used by individual module commands.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are optional and require Playwright Chromium:

```bash
python -m playwright install chromium
bladerecon screenshot hackerone.com
```

If Chromium is missing, BladeRecon displays a skip reason and continues.
Screenshot metadata includes average capture time, slow targets, timeout
targets, and per-target timings so slow browser captures are visible instead of
hidden inside total runtime.

## Signal Quality

Endpoint discovery suppresses third-party API URLs found inside in-scope
JavaScript unless the endpoint host is in scope. Historical JS endpoint
artifacts are merged into the same endpoint output so blocked live pages can
still contribute attack-surface evidence.

Advanced recon metadata includes source-level ROI for historical URL sources,
including selected URLs, opportunity candidates, source duration, and
signal-to-noise ratios. Use this to decide whether a source is worth its runtime
on future scans.

## Roadmap

### Current Release Candidate (v0.2.1)

- Finalize release consistency across CLI, reports, metadata, and scan state
- Validate real-world scans across Safe, Balanced, and Aggressive profiles
- Continue improving detection quality while keeping runtime efficient
- Expand regression coverage using real production-inspired scenarios
- Keep optional dependencies graceful, transparent, and well documented
- Gather community feedback before the first stable release

### Future Development (v0.3.0)

- Improve Opportunity Intelligence and evidence correlation
- Smarter target prioritization based on recon confidence
- Additional report intelligence without increasing noise
- Performance optimizations for very large scopes
- Better observability, diagnostics, and debugging information
- Continued UX improvements for researchers and bug bounty hunters
